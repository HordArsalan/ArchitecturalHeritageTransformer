# Architectural Heritage Transformer (AHT)

## Overview

The Architectural Heritage Transformer (AHT) is a framework designed to extend beyond traditional tangible-based Heritage BIM (HBIM) towards an ‘echo-based’ heritage digital twin using AI techniques. This framework leverages oral histories and collective memories to reconstruct lost heritage buildings through AI text-to-image generation tools.

## Contents
- `generate_prompt.py`: Python script to generate standardized heritage prompts from the AHT ontology.
- `AHT.rdf' The AHT ontology file in OWL format.
- `Supplementary Data and Results_.pdf`: Supplementary data and results supporting the research.
- `manual.md`: A comprehensive manual for users to generate images of lost heritage buildings.

## Installation

## Ontology

The ontology file (`AHT.rdf`) defines the classes and individuals used in the research.

## Python Script

The Python script (`generate_prompt.py`) loads the ontology and generates a standardised heritage prompt.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the `owlready2` library installed.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HordArsalan/ArchitecturalHeritageTransformer.git
