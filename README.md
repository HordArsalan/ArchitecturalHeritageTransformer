# Victorian Heritage Research

This repository contains the ontology and code used for my research on Victorian heritage buildings.

## Ontology

The ontology file (`VictorianHeritage.owx`) defines the classes and individuals used in the research.

## Python Script

The Python script (`generate_template.py`) loads the ontology and generates a standardized heritage prompt template.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the `owlready2` library installed.
3. Run the script using:
```sh
python3 generate_template.py
